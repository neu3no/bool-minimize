About
-------------
Bool-minimize is a basic implementation of the Quine-McClusky algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm) in javascript. 

Feel free do download or fork and share. If you wanna have a preview of the Implementation have a look here:

What it is able to
-------------
* read input from user by entering the corresponding one literals in a truth table
* generate an ordered table of prime implicants
* minimize this table by comparing
* generate a prime implicant chart
* optimize it by testing rows and columns


What it is _not_ able to (but might be later)
-------------
* read input by a givin term or function and generate truth table
* generate an optimized function
* draw as circuit of logical elements
